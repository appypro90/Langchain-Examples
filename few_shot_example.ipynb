    "Agent: Hello, thank you for calling TAL claims department. My name is Sarah, how can I assist you today?\n",
    "Customer: Hi Sarah, I’m calling about a claim I submitted for my car accident last week. I wanted to check the status and find out what happens next.\n",
    "Agent: I’m sorry to hear about your accident. I’ll certainly look into that for you. Can you please provide me with your claim number or policy number so I can locate your file?\n",
    "Customer: Sure, my claim number is 87654-AB.\n",
    "Agent: Thank you. Let me pull that up for you...Okay, I have your claim here. It looks like this was a claim for a collision, is that correct?\n",
    "Customer: Yes, that’s correct. It was a rear-end collision.\n",
    "Agent: I see. I can confirm that your claim was received last week on the 15th, and the adjuster assigned to your case is reviewing it. Have you been able to get an estimate for the damage yet?\n",
    "Customer: Yes, I took my car to the repair shop, and they provided an estimate of around $3,500 to fix the damage.\n",
    "Agent: Got it. Have you uploaded or sent that estimate to us yet? I don’t see it in the system here.\n",
    "Customer: Oh, I didn’t realize I needed to send it over. How should I do that?\n",
    "Agent: No problem! You can upload the estimate through our online claims portal, or if you prefer, I can email you a link where you can upload the document directly. Would that work for you?\n",
    "Customer: That sounds great. Could you please send me the link?\n",
    "Agent: Absolutely. I’ll email you the link right now, and once you have it, just follow the instructions to upload the estimate. I’ll keep an eye on the system, and as soon as we receive it, I’ll notify your adjuster.\n",
    "Cutomer: Okay, perfect! Thank you for that. I’ve been worried about how long this process would take.\n",
    "Agent:  I completely understand. Typically, once we receive the estimate, your adjuster will review it within 2-3 business days. They’ll reach out to you if they need any additional information or have any questions. After that, we’ll proceed with approving the repairs.\n",
    "Customer: That’s good to know. And how do I get my car repaired? Do I just take it back to the repair shop?\n",
    "Agent: Yes, once the estimate is approved, you can schedule your repair directly with the shop. If it’s one of our network shops, we’ll handle the payment directly with them. If it’s not, you might have to pay the repair shop first, and then we’ll reimburse you based on the approved amount.\n",
    "Customer: Ah, okay. I think the shop I went to is in your network, so I’ll just wait for the approval then. Is there anything else I need to do in the meantime?\n",
    "Agent: As long as the estimate gets uploaded and reviewed, that should be everything for now. Your adjuster will let you know if they need more details. You can also track your claim status through the online portal at any time.\n",
    "Customer: Great, I’ll upload the estimate right away. Oh, I have another question – my policy has rental car coverage. Will that apply since my car is in the shop?\n",
    "Agent: Yes, your policy does include rental car coverage. Once your claim is approved for repairs, we can arrange for a rental car. You can either use one of our partnered rental services, or if you have a preference, we can reimburse you up to the daily limit based on your coverage.\n",
    "Customer: That’s great to hear. How do I go about arranging the rental?\n",
    "Agent: If you’d like, I can go ahead and book the rental for you through our partner service once your repairs are scheduled. Alternatively, you can arrange it yourself and submit the receipt for reimbursement. Would you prefer to have us handle the rental booking?\n",
    "Customer: Yes, please go ahead and handle that. I’ll definitely need the car while mine is in the shop.\n",
    "Agent: No problem! I’ve noted that down. Once the repairs are approved and scheduled, I’ll contact you to finalize the rental details.\n",
    "Customer: Perfect! You’ve been really helpful, Sarah. I feel much better about the process now.\n",
    "Agent: I’m so glad to hear that! If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to give us a call. I’ll follow up with you once the estimate is reviewed.\n",
    "Customer: Thank you so much. I’ll upload the estimate right away!\n",

    "Agent: Thank you for explaining that. I’m glad to hear no one was hurt. Were the police involved, and did you file a report?\n",
    "Customer: Yes, the police came, and I have a copy of the report.\n",
    "Agent: Great. We’ll need a copy of that report to process the claim, but we can continue with the initial steps for now. Were there any other vehicles involved in the accident besides the one you rear-ended?\n",

    "Agent: You can upload them through our online claims portal. I’ll send you a link to access it, and you can follow the instructions to submit your photos and the police report. Does that sound okay?\n",
    "Customer: Yes, that works. Please send the link.\n",
    "Agent: I’ve just sent you the link. Once we receive the photos and police report, we’ll assign an adjuster to review the claim. They will reach out to you within 1-2 business days. Have you had an estimate for the damage to your vehicle yet?\n",
    "Customer: No, I haven’t taken the car to a shop yet. Should I do that now?\n",

    "Customer: I’ll probably go with one of your recommended shops. Is there anything else I need to do for the claim?\n",
    "Agent: Once you upload the photos and report, that should be all for now. Your adjuster will take it from there and guide you through the next steps, including repair arrangements and any additional details we may need.\n",
